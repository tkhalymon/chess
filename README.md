# How to build project (Ubuntu 14.04)

Launch `bash install_dev_env.sh` to install nescessary libraries
Use `cmake .` to generate Makefile in the root directory of project. Note that default Makefile will be owerwritten which is know issue (need to fix some configs)
Then use `make` to build project and `./chess` to run it
